# physics-lists
Create lists with physical animation effects.

This is a work in progress. demo.html contains the most up-to-date work-in-progress library. index.html is used for the live demo ([which can be found here](https://christiankaindl.github.io/physics-lists/)) :)

PS: Only tested in Firefox so far (on Webkit/Blink browsers scrolling is way too fast yet)

This project was inspired by
- first and foremost: the scrolling effect of the iOS default Messaging app
- SmoothMovement
- TweenJS
- easing.js (https://gist.github.com/gre/1650294)
- Smooth Scrollbar (https://github.com/idiotWu/smooth-scrollbar)
- and many more!

Just like all these libraries mentioned above, this project is licensed under the MIT license.
