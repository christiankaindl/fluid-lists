# physics-lists
Create lists with physical animation effects.

This is a work in progress. demo.html contains the current working in-progress library. main.js is broken :)

PS: Only tested in Firefox so far (on Webkit browsers scrolling is way too fast yet)

This project was inspired by
- first and foremeost: the scrolling effect of the iOS default Messenging app
- SmoothMovement
- TweenJS
- easingjs (https://gist.github.com/gre/1650294)
- Smooth Scrollbar (https://github.com/idiotWu/smooth-scrollbar)
- and many more!

Just like all these libraries mentioned above, this project is licensed under the MIT license.
